Hey, what did I tel you earlier? No one is getting replaced. Now, lets all be polite and give whatever it is up a nice, big Andys-room welcome. Buzz Lightyear to Star Command. Come in, Star Command. Star Command, come in. Do you read me? Why dont they answer? My ship! Blast! ThisII take weeks to repair. Buzz Lightyear mission log, stardate 4-0-7-2. My ship has run off course en route to sector 12. Ive crash-landed on a strange planet. The impact mustve awoken me from hypersleep. Terrain seems a bit unstable. No readout yet if the air is breathable. And there seems to be no sign of intelligent life anywhere. Hello! Whoa! H-hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Did I frighten you? Didnt mean to. Sorry. Howdy. My name is Woody. And this is Andys room. Thats all I wanted to say. And also, there has been a bit of a mix up. This is my spot, see, the bed here. Local law enforcement. Its about time you got here. Im Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger, Universe Protection Unit. My ship has crash-landed here by mistake. Yes, it is a mistake because, you see, the bed here is my spot. I need to repair my turbo boosters. Do you people still use fossil fuel or have you discovered crystallic fusion? Well, lets see. Weve got double-As. Watch yourself! Halt! Who goes there? Dont shoot! Its okay. friends. Do you know these life-forms? Yes! Theyre Andys toys. All right, everyone, youre clear to come up. I am Buzz Lightyear. I come in peace. Oh, Im so glad youre not a dinosaur. Wh-why, thank you! Now, thank you all for your kind welcome. Say, whats that button do? III show you. Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! Oh! Hey, Woodys got something like that. His is a pull string. Only its.... Only it sounds like a car rain over it. Oh, yeah, but not like this one. This is a quality sound system. Probably all copper wiring, huh? So, uh, where you from? Singapore? Hong Kong? Well, no. Actually, I-Im stationed up in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector 4. As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps, I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance. Oh,really? Im from Playskool. And Im from Mattel. Well, Im not really from Mattel. Im actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leverage buyout. Youd think theyd never seen a new toy before. Well, sure. Look at him! Hes got more gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife. Ah, ah, ah, ah! Please be careful. You dont want to be in the way when my laser goes off. Hey, a laser! How come you dont have a laser, Woody? Its not a laser! Its a.... Its a little light bulb that blinks. Whats with him? Laser envy. All right, thats enough! Look, were all very impressed with Andys new toy. Toy? T-O-Y. Toy. Excuse me, but I-I think the word youre searching for is Space Ranger. The word Im searching for I cant say because theres preschool toys present. Gettin kinda tense, arent ya? Uh, Mr. Lightyear, uh, now, Im curious. What does a space ranger actually do? Hes not a space ranger! He doesnt fight evil or, or shoot lasers or fly. Excuse me. Ooh! Oh, impressive wingspan! Very good! Oh, what? What? These are plastic. He cant fly. They are a tellurium-carbonic alloy, and I can fly. No, you cant. Yes, I can. You cant. Can. Cant! Cant! Cant! I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed! OK, then, Mr Light Beer, prove it. All right, then, I will. Stand back, everyone! To infinity and beyond! Can! Whoa! Oh, wow, you flew magnificently! I found my moving buddy. Thank you. Th-Thank you all. Thank you. That wasnt flying! That was... falling with style. Man, the dolls must really go for you. Can you teach me that? Golly Bob-Howdy. Oh, shut up! You know, in a couple days, everything will be just the way it was. TheyII see. TheyII see. Im still Andys favourite toy. I was on top of the world, living high It was right in my pocket I was living the life Things were just the way they should be When from out of the sky like a bomb Comes some little punk in a rocket Now all of a sudden Some strange things are happening to me Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! Strange things are happening to me Strange things Strange things are happening to me Aint no doubt about it I had friends I had lots of friends Now all my friends are gone And Im doing the best I can to carry on I had power I was respected But not any more And Ive lost the love to the one whom I adored Let me tell you about the strange things are happening to me Strange things Strange things are happening to me... Aint no doubt about it Strange things~ Strange things~ Finally! Hey, whos got my hat? Look, Im Woody. Howdy, howdy, howdy. Gimme that! Say there, Lizard and Stretchy Dog, let me show you something.

Dont let it get to you, Woody. Uh... let what? I dont, uh...... What do you mean? Who? I know Andys excited about Buzz. But you know heII always have a special place for you. Yeah, like the attic. All right, thats it! Hmm. Unidirectional bonding strip. Mr Lightyear wants more tape. Listen, Light Snack, you stay away from Andy. Hes mine, and no one is taking him from me. What are you talking about? Wheres that bonding strip? And another thingStop with this spaceman thing! Its getting on my nerves! Are you saying you wanna lodge a complaint with Star Command? Oh-ho, OK! Ooh, well, so you wanna do it the hard way, huh? Dont even think about it, cowboy. Oh, yeah, tough guy? The air isnt.... toxic. How dare you open a spacemans helmet on an uncharted planet! My eyeballs couldve been sucked from their sockets! You actually think youre the Buzz Lightyear? Oh, all this time I thought it was an act! Hey, guys, look! Its the real Buzz Lightyear! Youre mocking me, arent you? Oh, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. Buzz, look, an alien! Where?! Yes! Whoa! Uh-oh. Its Sid! Dont move! I thought he was at summer camp. They mustve kicked him out early this year. Oh, no, not Sid! Incoming! Who is it this time? I... I cant..... I cant tell. Hey, wheres Lenny? Right here, Woody. Oh, no, I cant bear to watch one of these again. Oh, no, its a Combat Carl. Whats going on? Nothing that concerns you spacemen, just us toys. Id better take a look anyway. Why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device? Thats whySid. Hmm, sure is a hairy fella. No, no, thats Scud, you idiot. That is Sid. You mean that happy child? That aint no happy child. He tortures toys, just for fun! Well, then, weve got to do something. What are you doing? Get down from there! Im gonna teach that boy a lesson. Yeah, sure. You go ahead. Melt him with your scary laser. Be careful with that, its extremely dangerous. Hes lighting it! Hes lighting it! Hit the dirt! Look out! Yes! Hes gone! Hes history! I could have stopped him. Buzz, I would love to see you try. Course Id love to see you as a crater. The sooner we move, the better. To infinity and beyond! Oh, all this packing makes me hungry.

This is the perfect time to panic! Im lost, Andy is gone! Theyre gonna move from their house in two days and its all your fault! My... My fault?! If you hadnt pushed me out of the window in the first place...! Oh, yeah? Well, if you hadnt shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me...! Dont tell me about importance! Because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy! What?! What are you talking about? Right now, poised at the edge of the galaxy, emperor Zurg has been secretly building a weapon with the destructive capacity to annihilate an entire planet! I alone have information that reveals his weapons only weakness. And you, my friend, are responsible for delaying my rendezvous with Star Command! You... are.... a... toy!!! Youre not the real Buzz Lightyear, youre an.... youre an action figure! You are a childs play thing! You are a sad, strange little man and you have my pity. Farewell. Oh, yeah, well, good riddance you looney. Rendez-vous with Star Command. Hey, Gas Dude! You talking to me? Pizza Planet? Andy! Yeah, man, can you help me? Do you know where Cutting Blvd. is? Just a moment... Oh, no. I cant show my face in that room without Buzz. Buzz! Buzz, come back! Go away! No, Buzz, youve gotta come back! I... I found a spaceship! Its a spaceship, Buzz! Come on, man, hurry up! Um, like the pizzas are getting cold here! Now, youre sure this space freighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply? Uh-huh. And when we get there, weII be able to find a way to transport you home. Well then, lets climb aboard. No, no, no, wait, Buzz, Buzz, lets get in the back. No one will see us there. Negative. There are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area. WeII be much safer in the cockpit. Yeah, but, Buzz! Buzz! so thats two lefts, and then a right, huh? Yeah. Okay, thanks for the directions. Buzz! But that man will see us. Its safer in the cockpit than the cargo bay. What an idiot. Next shuttle lift-off scheduled for T-minus 30 minutes and counting... You are clear to enter. Welcome to Pizza Planet. The white zone is for eating pizza only. The white zone is for... Sheriff. There you are. Now the entrance is heavily guarded. We need a way to get inside. Great idea, Woody. I like your thinking. You are clear to enter. Welcome to Pizza Planet. Now! Quickly, guys, the airlock is closing. Jones, party of fiveYour shuttle is now boarding at counter 12.

I come in peace. Tell us! What is it like outside? This is an intergalactic emergency! I need to commandeer your vessel to Sector 12! Whos in charge here? The cla-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-w!! The claw is our master. The claw chooses who will go and who will stay. This is ludicrous. Hey, bozo, you got a brain in there? Ha-ha, take that! Oh, no! Sid! Get down! Whats gotten into you, Sheriff? I was -- YOU are the one that decided to climb into this -- Sh-h-h-h-h-h. The claw. It moves. I have been chosen!! Farewell, my friends! I go on to a better place.

Locked. Theres gotta be another way out of here. Uh, guys? W-W-Was that you? Hey! Hi, there, little fellah! Come out here. Do you know a way out of here? . A toy uses his hand to turn off the torch, promoting Woody to jump onto Buzz and cling onto him in fear] B-B-B-Buzz! Theyre cannibals. May day! May day! Come in, Star Command! Send reinforcements! Star Command, do you copy? Ive set my laser from stun to kill. Oh, great, great. Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink em to death. Hey, you guys! I think Ive found him. Buzz! Is that you?! Whiskers! Will you get out of here?! Youre interfering with the search and rescue. Look! Theyre home! Mom, have you seen Woody? Where was the last place you left him? Right here in the van. Oh, Im sure hes there. Youre just not looking hard enough. Hes not here, Mom. Woodys gone. Woodys gone? Well what do you know, the weasel ran away. Huh?! Huh?! I told you he was guilty.

Well, we have ways of making you talk. Where are your rebel friends now? Sid, your Pop Tarts are ready. Alright! on the floor, and dunks his head in. Buzz runs over to Woody, pausing to remove two suction cup darts from his person before pulling Woody out of the bowl. Two colorful Froot-Loops stick to each of Woodys eyes like glasses] Are you alright? Im proud of you, Sheriff. A lesser man would have talked under such torture. I sure hope this isnt permanent. Still no word from Star Command. Were not that far from the spaceport -- The door! Its open! Were free!! Woody, we dont know whats out there! Ill tell you wha... Theyre gonna eat us, Buzz!! Do something! Quick! Shield your eyes! Its not working! I recharged it before I left. It should be good for hours -- Oh, you idiot! Youre a toy! Use your karate chop action! Get away! Hoo-cha!

Sid Phillips reporting. Launch of the shuttle has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions at the launch site. Tomorrows forecast... Sunny. Ha-ha-ha. Sweet dreams.

You must not be thinking clearly. No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly. You were right all along. Im not a Space Ranger. Im just a toy. A stupid little insignificant toy. Woah hey. Being a toy is a lot better than being a, a Space Ranger. Yeah, right. No, it is. Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and its not because youre a Space Ranger, pal, its because youre a toy. You are his toy. But why would Andy want me?

Youve got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a COOL toy. As a matter of fact youre too cool. I mean -- I mean what chance does a toy like me have against a Buzz Lightyear action figure? All I can do is... Theres a snake in my boots. Why would Andy ever want to play with me, when hes got you? Im the one that should be strapped to that rocket. Listen, Buzz, forget about us. You should get outta here while you can. Buzz!! What are you doing? We thought you were -- Come on, Sheriff.
